# IEO-project
## Introduction
This is a public repository on a effort for the analysis of the proposed article. One of the emphasis of this project is its reproducibility; meaning that replicating the results can be obtained by running the same code on the same data, regardless of who is running the code and where it is being run. 

Reproducibility is core in data analysis for ensuring the transparency, reliability, and accuracy of research findings, as well as for facilitating collaboration and building upon existing work.
